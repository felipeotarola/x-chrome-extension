# Chrome Extension Icons

Since we don't have actual icon files, you'll need to create icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for the extension toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for the extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for the Chrome Web Store)

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator. The icons should represent the AI/tweet helper theme - perhaps a robot emoji or AI-related symbol.

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
